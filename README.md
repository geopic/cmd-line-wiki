# cmd-line-wiki

Browse content from English-language Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org) in the terminal using the `less` program. Requires Unix shell and a working internet connection to run.

## Usage

Download the `wiki` file to any directory (preferably a directory within your `$PATH` so you can run it from any location), mark as executable with `chmod 755 ./wiki` or `chmod +x ./wiki` and then run the script with `./wiki <name of article>`. If you have downloaded the `wiki` file to a location within your `$PATH` then you can run the script with `wiki <name of article>` from anywhere.
